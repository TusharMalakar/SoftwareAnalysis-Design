/** @file README.txt */

1) All parts were completed and compiled successfully, following the comments in testTree.cpp and queryTree.cpp, and being able to print all of the required output successfully and query, respectively. No error occurs based on my computation. 

2) No bugs based on the instructions given were found.

3) When compiling on a Linux terminal, with the files on your home/user folder/folder where you put the files in your directory, you can simply write:
make all
./queryTree rebase210.txt FLAG (where FLAG = BST and AVL)
./testTree rebase210.txt sequences.txt FLAG (where FLAG = BST and AVL)
		
4) The input files are rebase210.txt and sequences.txt. There are no output files. 
The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with trees and compare the performance
of the basic binary search tree with the self-balancing AVL tree. You will also work with a
real world data set and construct a generic test routine for comparing several different
implementations of the tree container class. You are encouraged to use the book‚Äôs
implementation for the BST and AVL trees. You can get the code from:
https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~weiss/dsaa_c++4/code/
--BinarySearchTree.h, AvlTree.h, dsexceptions.h
Part 1 (10 points)
First, create a class object named SequenceMap that has as private data members the
following two:
string recognition_sequence_ ;
vector<string> enzyme_acronyms_;
Other than the big-five (note that you can use the defaults for all of them), you have to add
the following:
a) A constructor SequenceMap(const string &a_rec_seq, const
string &an_enz_acro),that constructs a SequenceMap from two strings
(note that now the vector enzyme_acronyms_ will contain just one element,
the an_enz_acro).
b) bool operator<(const SequenceMap &rhs) const, that operates
based on the regular string comparison between the
recognition_sequence_ strings (this will be a one line function).
c) Overload the operator<< for SequenceMap.
d) void Merge(const SequenceMap &other_sequence). This function
assumes that the object‚Äôs recognition_sequence_ and
other_sequence.recognition_sequence_ are equal to each other. The
function Merge() merges the other_sequence.enzyme_acronym_ with
the object‚Äôs enzyme_acronym_. The other_sequence object will not be
affected.
This class (which is non-templated) will be used in the following programs. First test it with
your own test functions to make sure that it operates correctly.
Part 2
Introduction to the problem
For this assignment you will receive as input two text files, rebase210.txt and
sequences.txt. After the header, each line of the database file rebase210.txt
contains the name of a restriction enzyme and possible DNA sites the enzyme may cut (cut
location is indicated by a ‚Äò) in the following format:
enzyme_acronym/recognition_sequence/‚Ä¶/recognition_sequence//
For instance the first few lines of rebase210.txt are:
AanI/TTA'TAA//
AarI/CACCTGCNNNN'NNNN/'NNNNNNNNGCAGGTG//
AasI/GACNNNN'NNGTC//
AatII/GACGT'C//
AbsI/CC'TCGAGG//
AccI/GT'MKAC//
AccII/CG'CG//
AccIII/T'CCGGA//
Acc16I/TGC'GCA//
Acc36I/ACCTGCNNNN'NNNN/'NNNNNNNNGCAGGT//
‚Ä¶
That means that each line contains one enzyme acronym associated with one or more
recognition sequences. For example on line 2:
The enzyme acronym AarI corresponds to the two recognition sequences
CACCTGCNNNN'NNNN and 'NNNNNNNNGCAGGTG.
Part 2(a) (45 points)
You will create a parser to read in this database and construct a search tree (either a
regular BST or an AVL tree). For each line of the database and for each recognition
sequence in that line, you will create a new SequenceMap object that contains the
recognition sequence as its recognition_sequence_ and the enzyme acronym as the only
string of its enzyme_acronyms_, and you will insert this object into the tree. This is
explained with the following pseudo code:
Tree<SequenceMap> a_tree;
string db_line;
// Read the file line-by-line:
while (GetNextLineFromDatabaseFile(db_line)) {
// Get the first part of the line:
string an_enz_acro = GetEnzymeAcronym(db_line);
string a_reco_seq;
while (GetNextRegocnitionSequence(db_line, a_rego_seq){
SequenceMap new_sequence_map(a_reco_seq, an_enz_acro);
a_tree.insert(new_sequence_map);
} // End second while.
} // End first while.
In the case that the new_sequence_map.recognition_sequence_ equals the
recognition_sequence_ of a node X in the tree, then the search tree‚Äôs insert() function
will call the X.Merge(new_sequence_map) function of the existing element. This will
have the effect of updating the enzyme_acronym_ of X. Note, that this will be part of the
functionality of the insert() function. The Merge() will only be called in case of duplicates as
described above. Otherwise, no Merge() is required and the new_sequence_map will be
inserted into the tree.
To implement the above, write a test program named query_tree which will use your
parser to create a search tree and then allow the user to query it using a recognition
sequence. If that sequence exists in the tree then this routine should print all the
corresponding enzymes that correspond to that recognition sequence.
Your programs should run from the terminal as follows:
query_tree <database file name> <flag>
<flag> should be ‚ÄúBST‚Äù for binary search tree, and ‚ÄúAVL‚Äù for AVL tree.
For example you can write on the terminal:
./query_tree rebase210.txt BST
The user should enter THREE strings (supposed to be recognition sequences) for instance:
CC'TCGAGG
TTA'TAA
TC'C
Your program should print in the standard output their associated enzyme acronyms. In the
above example the output will be
AbsI
AanI PsiI
Not Found
I will test it with a file containing three strings and run your code like that:
./query_trees rebase210.txt BST < input_part2a.txt
./query_trees rebase210.txt AVL < input_part2a.txt
Part2(b) (45 points)
Next, create a test routine named test_tree that does the following in the sequence
described below:
1. Parses the database and construct a search tree (this is the same as in Part2(a)).
2. Prints the number of nodes in your tree ùëõ.
3. Computes the average depth of your search tree, i.e. the internal path length
divided by ùëõ.
a. Prints the average depth.
b. Prints the ratio of the average depth to log! ùëõ. E.g., if average depth is 6.9
and log! ùëõ = 5.0, then you should print !.!
!.! = 1.38.
4. Searches (find()) the tree for each string in the sequences.txt file. Also counts
the total number of recursive calls for all executions of find().
a. Prints the total number of successful queries (number of strings found).
b. Prints the average number of recursion calls, i.e. #total number of
recursion calls / number of queries.
5. Removes every other sequence in sequences.txt from the tree. Also counts the
total number of recursion calls for all executions of remove().
a. Prints the total number successful removes.
b. Prints the average number of recursion calls, i.e. #total number of
recursion calls / number of remove calls.
6. Redo steps 2 and 3:
a. Prints number of nodes in your tree.
b. Prints the average depth.
c. Prints the ratio of the average depth to log! ùëõ.
The output of Part2(b) should be of the exact form:
2: <integer>
3a: <float>
3b: <float>
4a: <integer>
4b: <float>
5a: <integer>
5b: <float>
6a: <integer>
6b: <float>
6c: <float>
If you didn‚Äôt complete a step, just print after the step number: Not Done
---------
For both Part2(a) and Part2(b) you must write the test routine using templates so each tree
can be used interchangeably. The trees should have identical interfaces.
Your program should run from the terminal as follows:
test_tree <database file name> <queries file name> <flag>
<flag> should be ‚ÄúBST‚Äù for binary search tree, and ‚ÄúAVL‚Äù for AVL tree.
For example you can write on terminal
./test_tree rebase210.txt sequences.txt AVL
You will be given a mandatory Makefile, along with some code to start (start of main
functions query_tree.cc test_tree.cc
