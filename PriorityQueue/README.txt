i. All parts were completed, in fact I’ve implemented the ability to store, query and delete duplicates as an added feature. My 100_test_deletion contains duplicates for testing.

ii. There are no bugs that I know of, 

iii. To run this program simply unzip and type "make all" in a terminal window within the same directory as the files. This program has 4 makefile commands:

run100s makes: ./TestSearch 100_numbers.txt 100_test_search.txt
run100d makes: ./TestDelete 100_numbers.txt 100_test_deletion.txt
run1000s makes: ./TestSearch 1000_numbers.txt 1000_test_search.txt
run1000d makes: ./TestDelete 1000_numbers.txt 1000_test_deletion.txt

iv. This program doesn't write to any files and only displays the output on screen.
