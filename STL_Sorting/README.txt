1) Assignment 4 has been completed and compiled successfully.

2)There is no bug. I used "makefile" to complete the project.

3)Type "make all" to compile the project. After it is done compiling:


./test_sorting_algorithms <input_type> <input_size> <comparison_type>
 

    Try " ./test_sorting_algorithms random 20000 less"

_____________________________________________________________
compare various sorting algorithms. You will also
modify the algorithms in order for a Comparator class to be used for comparisons.
To start you should write a small function that verifies that a collection is in sorted order:
template <typename Comparable, typename Comparator>
bool VerifyOrder(const vector<Comparable> &input, Comparator
less_than)
The above function should return true iff the input is in sorted order according to the
Comparator. For example, in order to check whether a vector of integers (vector<int>
input_vector) is sorted from smaller to larger, you need to call
VerifyOrder(input_vector, less<int>{});
If you want to check whether the vector is sorted from larger to smaller you need to call
VerifyOrder(input_vector, greater<int>{});
Note that in order to use less<int>{} and greater<int>{} , you should #include <functional>.
The next step is to modify the code of heapsort, quicksort and mergesort (provided in the
book), such that a Comparator us used. For example, the signature for quicksort will
become:
template <typename Comparable, typename Comparator>
quicksort(vector<Comparable> &a, Comparator less_than);
Part 1 (60 points)
In order to check the running time of the three algorithms, create a driver program that will
be executed as follows:
./test_sorting_algorithms <input_type> <input_size> <comparison_type>,
where <input_type> can be random or sorted, <input_size> is the number of elements of
the input, and <comparison_type> is either less or greater.
For example, you can run
./test_sorting_algorithms random 20000 less
The above will produce a random vector of 20000 integers, and apply all three algorithms
using the less<int>{} Comparator.
You can also run
./test_sorting_algorithms sorted 10000 greater
The above will produce the vector of integers containing 1 through 10000 in that order, and
will test the three algorithms using the greater<int>{} Comparator.
To generate a random vector you can use this piece of code:
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
void GenerateRandomVector(vector<int> &a, size_t size_of_vector) {
a.clear();
srand(time(0));
for (size_t i = 0; i < size_of_vector; ++i)
a.push_back(rand());
}
Suppose that you execute
./test_sorting_algorithms random 20000 less
The output should look as follows (see next page):
--------
Running sorting algorithms: random, 200000 numbers, less (<-
this shows the parameters of the program)
HeapSort: Runtime: X ns (<- use the timing routines of the
previous assignment)
Verified: 1 (<- this should be the output of the
VerifyOrder() function to be executed after the end of the
sorting procedure).
MergeSort: <Same as above>
QuickSort: <Same as above>
-------
Part 2 (40 points)
Test some variations of the quicksort algorithm. Investigate the following pivot
selection procedures:
a) Median of three (as in the slides)
b) Middle pivot (always select the middle item in the array)
c) First pivot (always select the first item in the array)
The executable should run using the same parameters as in Part 1:
./test_qsort_algorithm <input_type> <input_size> <comparison_type>
If for example you run it as
./test_qsort_algorithm random 20000 less
Then output should be of the form (see next page):
Testing quicksort: random, 200000 numbers, less (<- this
shows the parameters of the program)
Median of three
Runtime: X ns
Verified: 1
