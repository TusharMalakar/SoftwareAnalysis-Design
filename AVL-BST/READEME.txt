1) All parts were completed and compiled successfully, following the comments in testTree.cpp and queryTree.cpp, and being able to print all of the required output successfully and query, respectively. No error occurs based on my computation. 

2) No bugs based on the instructions given were found.

3) When compiling on a Linux terminal, with the files on your home/user folder/folder where you put the files in your directory, you can simply write:
make all
./queryTree rebase210.txt FLAG (where FLAG = BST and AVL)
./testTree rebase210.txt sequences.txt FLAG (where FLAG = BST and AVL)
		
4) The input files are rebase210.txt and sequences.txt. There are no output files.
