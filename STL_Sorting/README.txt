1) Assignment 4 has been completed and compiled successfully.

2)There is no bug. I used "makefile" to complete the project.

3)Type "make all" to compile the project. After it is done compiling:


./test_sorting_algorithms <input_type> <input_size> <comparison_type>
 

    Try " ./test_sorting_algorithms random 20000 less"
